# XFakePlayers-GoldSrc

**Project Description:**
XFakePlayers-GoldSrc is a collection of reworked ZBots for games on the GoldSrc platform. The bots are integrated with Lua scripting, allowing for easy customization and editing, which makes it more versatile for developers and players.

**Features:**

1. **Easy Setup**:  
   These bots can be easily configured and customized through a client interface, providing maximum convenience for tweaking various parameters.

2. **Support for All GoldSrc Games**:  
   The bots are client-side and can be used in any game that runs on the GoldSrc engine, such as Counter-Strike and Half-Life.

3. **Advanced Navigation System**:  
   The navigation system is adapted from the bots in Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which allows for seamless navigation across maps. These waypoints can be easily modified to adapt to new maps or specific game styles.

4. **Experimental Features**:  
   The bots have various experimental features such as flood functions, enabling players to test game servers or simply have fun with friends in private lobbies.

5. **Interaction Capabilities**:  
   The bots are capable of interacting with real players, shooting through obstacles, and performing complex actions similar to human players.

6. **Usage Restrictions**:  
   Please note that the use of these bots for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited.

7. **Multilingual Comments and Code Clarity**:  
   The code has been updated to include detailed comments in both Russian and English, ensuring that developers from different backgrounds can understand and contribute.
